ADS Final Project - Bike Sharing Demand

## Prepare for run the bike sharing demand project
 
* Configure python 2.7 environment 

* Install jupyter with pip: 

   pip install jupyter

* Save train dataset and test dataset in the folder data

* For Data Exploration: 

pip install matplotlib

* For RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor Models:

pip install sklearn

* For LSTM model

pip install keras

pip install TensorFlow

pip install h5py (saving Keras models to disk).

Create a folder named models 

## Steps: 
### 1. Data Cleaning
### 2. Data Exploration/Visualization
#### Basic Features

2.1 the relationship between season feature and count

2.2 the relationship between weather feature and count

2.3 the relationship between hour/weekingday feature and count

2.4 the relationship between temp feature and count

2.5 the relationship between wind speed feature and count

2.6 the relationship between humidity feature and count

#### Additional Features

2.7 create rush hour feature as peak

2.8 create ideal environment feature as ideal

2.9 create sticky humidity feature as sticky

### 3. Model Build

3.1 Data Split for model

3.2 Target features for model

3.3 Random Forest

3.4 GradientBoostingRegressor

3.5 Sequential Model with LSTM Layers

### 4. Pridect Test Dataset
